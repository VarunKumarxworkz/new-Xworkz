1.Constructor :
          
		   its is an special method Which is Used to Create an Object.
Types:
		 there are two types
         
        *Default Constructor 
        *Parameterized Constructor		

*Default Constructor:
                      Without Any Parameterized Values Is Called Default Constructor
					  
*Parameterized Constructor:					  
					        With Parameterized Values Is Called Parameterized Constructor
					  
			
2.Features Of Java:
         
		 *Java is Simple.
		 *Java is Strong.
		 *Java is MultiThreaded.
		 *Java is Object Oriented Language.
		 *Java is Platform Indipendent.
		 *Java is Safe and Secure.
		 
		 
		 
	*Java is Simple:
		  
		  Java is Simple Because We Can Learn And Operate Easily.
		  
	*Java is Strong:
                  
          Java is Strong Because it has Jvm.				  
		  
	*Java is MultiThreaded:
  
          Java is MultiThreaded Because It can Acess Many Program at a time.
    
    *Java is Object Oriented Language:
	     
		 Java is Object Oriented Language Because We Use Objects For Programming.
		
	*Java is Platform Indipendent:

         Java Can runs in Any Platform   Like(Windows,Os,Mac,) etc... 	
		  

3.Difference Between C++ and Java:		  

         *C++ and Java Where Differ By Their Platfron Dependency.
         *C++ and Java Where Differ By Their Memory Management.
         *C++ and Java Where Differ By Their Uses Of Class.


4.Difference Between JDK,JRE,JVM:

   *JDK:
          JDK is known as Java Development Kit Which is Present with Some Tools.
 
   *JRE:
          JRE is known as Java Runtime Environment Which is Present with Laibreries.
	
   *JVM:  JVM is known as Java Virtual Machine Which is Used to Protect Java Codes.
   
   
5.Types Of Memory Areas Allocated by JVM:

   *Constant Pool:
                   Constant Pool Which Stores The Primitive DataTypes Values.
				   Like (int,byte,short)Etc...
				   
				   
   *Instance Pool:
                   Instance Pool Which Store The Non Primitive DataTypes.   
                   Like (String,Class) Etc...  
   
6.Methods:
           A Method is a Function Which Collect Codes or Block which is used to perform Some Task.

  Decleration of Method:
  		      lets Take a Main Method as a Example
           
   public static void main(String[] args){}

   **public :
		      public is an Acess Specifier it Tells Who Can Access this File.
			    
				
		like a public there are few Acess Specifier Like (private)
   

   **static:
              static is an Non Access Specifier 

   **void:			  
             void is an return Type Which we can return.  
   **main :
            main is an method which can Give. 
			
   At last with an Paranthises.			
   
   
   
 7.Method OverLoading With Example:
                                    MethodOverloading Means the Method Which having An same referenceName but Different Parameters.
									
								we can Differentiate with 3 Ways or Methods.	
									
									*Parameterized values Length.
									*Different DataTypes.
									*and OrderOfArrangment.
			Example:

                Lenght:
                     overload();
					 overload(1);
					 overload(1,2,3);
					 
					 
				DataTypes:
                          overload(int);
						  overload(byte);
						  
				OrderOfArrangment:
				                   overload(int,byte,int)
								   
								   
								   
								   
			public static void Gym(dumbell);
            public static void Gym(dumbell,barbell);

8.Difference Between Constructor and Method:
      
	    Constructor: 
                     Constructor is an special Method Which is Used to Create An Object.
					 
					 they Where with three rules:
					 *no Return Tpe.
					 *Class name and Constructor name Should be same.
					 
					 
        Method :
		          A Method is a Function Which Collect Codes or Block which is used to perform Some Task.
				  
				  *it has ReturnType
				  
9.static variable:
                  a Variable Decleared as a static that is called static variable.


      *static Method: 				  
				      it can be Accessable Without Creating a Object by Using of static KeyWord.
      *static Block:
	                 it is used to initializing the static variable
                     JVM Execute the static Block Before the Main Method

10.Constructor OverLoading:
                           it is a Technique of calling more than one constructor with Different Parameter List.					 
					  
				  
	Example:			  
              public class constructor{
			  
			  
			  public constructor(){
			  System.out.println("default constructor");
			  }
			  
			  public constructor(int value){
			  System.out.println(value);
			  }
			  
			  public constructor(String name){
			  System.out.println(name);
			  }
			  
			  public static void main(String[] args ){
			  constructor give = new constructor();
			  
			  
			  give.value;
			  give.name;
			  }
